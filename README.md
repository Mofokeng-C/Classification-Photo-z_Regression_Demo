# Classification and Photo-z Regression of Astronomical Sources 

This is a tutorial that uses two machine learning algorithms: random forest and k-nearest neighbor classifiers to disentangle three different classes (stars, galaxies and quasars) and also estimate photometric redshifts by using colour magnitudes as features to learn. The reference dataset uses corrected photometric magnitudes from SDSS together with corresponding WISE magnitudes. 

The tutorial uses a reference dataset : sdss_all_small_dr16_allwise_red.fits.gz - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_c1IyvpbT-v3LRuho3rNQPMCWDD24Hde/view?usp=sharing
